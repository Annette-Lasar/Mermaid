            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <h3>Liability for content</h3>
            <p>
              The contents of our pages were created with the utmost care.
              However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and
              timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are
              responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with
              general laws pursuant to Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act
              (TMG). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated
              as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
              information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
              activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information
              under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this
              regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific
              infringement. Upon becoming aware of corresponding infringements,
              we will remove this content immediately.
            </p>

            <h3>Liability for links</h3>

            <p>
              Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on
              whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume
              any liability for these external contents. The respective provider
              or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of
              the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
              violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not
              recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent content
              control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
              evidence of a violation of law. Upon becoming aware of legal
              violations, we will remove such links immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
              The use of our website is usually possible without providing
              personal data. As far as personal data (e.g., name, address, or
              email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on
              a voluntary basis, as far as possible. This data will not be

              like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g.,
              communication by email) can have security vulnerabilities.
              Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
              possible. The use of contact data published within the scope of
              the imprint obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited

              prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right
              to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of
              advertising information, such as through spam emails.
